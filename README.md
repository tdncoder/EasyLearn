<h1>Propose</h1>

Based on the current situation, many people around the world, in addition to going to work to learn and improve their knowledge, search on Google to find documents. They have too much knowledge to absorb but don't know how to summarize the knowledge enough, learn things to apply to real world... There are many problems happening, so this is the reason why this website will help many people in the world.

<h1>Content</h1>

This website consists of 3 parts: API, Admin, Client.
- API: Admin or Client calls commands to retrieve data to return to the user.
- Admin: manages course information, manages trainers and other members of the finance team.
- Client: They can buy and watch videos online courses without going to the library. They can take quizzes in the course to understand the lessons better.

<h1>Describe my work in the project</h1>

- Build a course list page including registered user courses, hot courses...
- Built a course detail page, displaying course information for users.
- Build a course payment page using a 3rd party (Stripe) for users to make payments.

<h1>Result</h1>

After implementing this project with the team, I learned how to build Microservice code, use a 3rd party to make payments, understand more about how servlets work, and how to apply springboot to the project.

<h1>How to run the website</h1>

- After downloading the project, we will run APIService first. Wait a while after finishing running (showing "Spring start"), then we will run the Admin folder and then go to the Client folder.
- This project is run in local so you can change another port to run it if you got the error from port.
- http://localhost:9092/student-course (This is the Client page).
- http://localhost:9091/admin (This is the Admin page).
- Must ensure that APIService finishes running to display other pages.
